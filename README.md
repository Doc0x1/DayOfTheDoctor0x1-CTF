# Day of The Doctor0x1 CTF Challenge
This will be my first attempt at making a semi-decent CTF challenge. It should not be that difficult, but I hope you enjoy it.

### If you have feedback, you can find me in the [Hack Nexus Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6tSbqvn7K6)

## Challenge
Running the binary will present you with a "flag" that isn't quite a flag. The rest is up to you.

**You are free to run the binary through VirusTotal or anything you like to check if it's malicious.**

I will be updating this repository with the uncompiled challenge file when this challenge is solved for the first time.

## **Getting Started**

### **Precompiled Binaries**
This repository contains a single precompiled binary that can be run on a Linux system. I recommend using WSL or Hyper-V with a Linux VM to solve this.
- **Linux (x86_64)**: `day_of_the_doctor0x1_linux_x86_64`

## **Challenge Rules**
1. **DO NOT** share the solution publicly.
2. You may use any tools or techniques to investigate the binary.
3. The flag format is: `flag{...}`.
4. Have fun, and let me know what you think afterwards.
